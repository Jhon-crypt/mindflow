Edge Cases (Tricky Ones)

When counselor says almost nothing:

Input: "Session happened. Client fine. Same plan." Output: Uses mostly defaults but still
makes complete note


When counselor rambles:

Input: "So the client came in and we talked for a while about various things including his mother
and his job and his dog died last week which was sad and he's been sober I think he said 45
days or maybe 44 I can't remember exactly but around that and we did some CBT stuff and
breathing and I gave him the usual homework sheets." Output: Picks out the important parts
and ignores the rambling


When counselor uses slang:

Input: "Dude was totally tweaking but he's clean now. Been hitting meetings hard." Output:
"Client previously exhibited substance use symptoms but currently maintains sobriety. Actively
attending support meetings."
