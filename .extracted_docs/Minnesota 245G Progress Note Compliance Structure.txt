The Five Required Sections (Must Have All Five)
1. SERVICE PROVIDED

What this section needs:

   ●​   Type of service (individual, group, or family therapy)
   ●​   Exact duration in minutes (not "45-50 minutes" but "50 minutes")
   ●​   Where it happened (in-person, telehealth, clinic, home)
   ●​   ASAM level of care (like "Level 2.1 IOP" or "Level 1.0 outpatient")

Good example: "Provided 50-minute individual substance use disorder counseling session at
ASAM Level 2.1 intensive outpatient program via in-person service"

Bad example: "Had a session with client" (missing everything required)




2. CLIENT RESPONSE

What this section needs:

   ●​   How engaged were they? (active, passive, resistant)
   ●​   What did they actually say? (use direct quotes)
   ●​   What did you observe? (body language, mood, appearance)
   ●​   Did they admit to using or deny it?
   ●​   How did they react to what you did in session?
Good example: "Client presented with stable mood and clear thought process, actively
engaged in discussion of triggers, stating 'I recognized three high-risk situations this week and
used coping skills.' Demonstrated understanding of relapse prevention concepts by identifying
personal warning signs. Reported 7 days of continuous sobriety verified by negative UA.
Exhibited appropriate affect when discussing recovery challenges."

Never write:

   ●​ "Client seems to be doing better" (too vague)
   ●​ "Probably understands the concepts" (not observable)
   ●​ "Maybe ready for change" (speculation)




3. INTERVENTIONS

What this section needs:

   ●​   Name the specific therapy you used (CBT, DBT, Motivational Interviewing, etc.)
   ●​   What techniques or exercises you actually did
   ●​   Which ASAM dimension you addressed (1-6)
   ●​   What skills you taught
   ●​   What homework you gave them

Approved interventions to use:

   ●​   Motivational Interviewing (MI)
   ●​   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
   ●​   Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
   ●​   12-Step Facilitation
   ●​   Relapse Prevention
   ●​   Seeking Safety
   ●​   Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention

Good example: "Implemented Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques targeting Dimension 4
(Readiness to Change) including cost-benefit analysis of continued use versus recovery. Utilized
motivational interviewing to explore ambivalence regarding treatment engagement. Taught
HALT (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) identification skills for Dimension 5 (Relapse Potential).
Assigned thought record homework to identify cognitive distortions related to substance use."

Bad example: "Did therapy and talked about recovery" (too generic)




4. PROGRESS
What this section needs:

   ●​   Reference a specific treatment plan goal (Goal #1, Goal #2, etc.)
   ●​   Say if they're getting better, staying the same, or getting worse
   ●​   Include numbers (days sober, meeting attendance, scores)
   ●​   Mention ASAM dimension changes if any
   ●​   Include test results if you have them (UA results, PHQ-9 scores)

Things you can measure:

   ●​   Days sober/clean
   ●​   Number of meetings attended
   ●​   Homework completed (yes/no)
   ●​   How often they used coping skills
   ●​   Taking medications as prescribed
   ●​   Attendance percentage
   ●​   Drug test results
   ●​   Depression/anxiety scores

Good example: "Client demonstrating progress toward Goal #1 (maintain sobriety) with 14
consecutive days abstinent, verified by negative UA collected today. Dimension 5 (Relapse
Potential) risk decreased from 3 to 2 based on increased coping skill utilization reported in 4 of 5
high-risk situations this week. Attended 3 of 3 scheduled IOP sessions (100% attendance)."




5. PLAN

What this section needs:

   ●​   What you'll focus on next session
   ●​   Homework they need to do
   ●​   Any referrals you're making
   ●​   Changes to the treatment plan
   ●​   How often they'll keep coming

Good example: "Continue weekly individual sessions at current ASAM 2.1 level focusing on
relapse prevention and Dimension 5 risk reduction. Client to complete trigger identification
worksheet and attend minimum 3 AA meetings before next session on Tuesday. Will address
trauma history using Seeking Safety curriculum beginning next session. Referred to psychiatric
evaluation for medication assessment, appointment scheduled 8/15."

Bad example: "Continue treatment" (way too vague)
Important Rules to Remember
Timing Requirements

   ●​ Regular sessions: Document within 7 days
   ●​ Crisis or significant events: Document within 24 hours
   ●​ If you're late: Write "Late Entry" and explain why

Signature Requirements

You must include:

   ●​   Your full name
   ●​   Your credentials (LADC, LICSW, etc.)
   ●​   Your job title
   ●​   Date you're signing
   ●​   Time if signing same day as service

Example: "John Smith, LADC, Chemical Dependency Counselor, 08/03/2024 14:30"

If you're not licensed, your supervisor must also sign within 7 days.

Language Rules

Never use these terms:

   ●​   "Drug addict" → Say "person with substance use disorder"
   ●​   "Clean/dirty" → Say "positive/negative UA" or "in recovery/actively using"
   ●​   "Drug abuse" → Say "substance use"
   ●​   "Alcoholic" → Say "person with alcohol use disorder"

Always include:

   ●​   At least one ASAM dimension (1-6)
   ●​   At least one treatment goal reference
   ●​   At least one number/measurement
   ●​   Person-first language




Quick Template for Speed
If you need to write a note fast, use this format:
SERVICE PROVIDED: [Type] [Minutes] minute [individual/group] session at ASAM Level
[number]

CLIENT RESPONSE: Client [engaged/resisted], stated "[quote]", demonstrated [behavior],
reported [#] days sober

INTERVENTIONS: Implemented [CBT/MI/DBT] addressing Dimension [#], taught [skill],
assigned [homework]

PROGRESS: Progress toward Goal #[number]: [improved/maintained/declined], [specific
metric], Dimension [#] risk [changed/stable]

PLAN: Continue [frequency] sessions, focus on [topic], client will [assignment], next session
[date]




The Bottom Line
Every single progress note needs:

   1.​ All 5 sections (no exceptions)
   2.​ At least one ASAM dimension mentioned
   3.​ At least one measurable number
   4.​ At least one treatment goal reference
   5.​ Professional language (no slang or judgments)
   6.​ Your full signature with credentials

If you have these 6 things, your note is compliant with Minnesota 245G requirements.
